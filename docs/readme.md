## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The Travel-Rizz project is structured to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Key directories and files are organized as follows:

- `pages/` ‚Äî Next.js pages, including:
  - `index.tsx` ‚Äî Landing page
  - `chat/` ‚Äî AI chat interface for trip planning
  - `travel-form.tsx` ‚Äî Multi-step trip planning form
  - `articles/` ‚Äî Guides: service, visa, trip preparation
  - `payment-success.tsx` ‚Äî Payment confirmation
  - `privacy.tsx`, `cookies.tsx`, `terms.tsx` ‚Äî Legal pages
- `components/` ‚Äî Reusable UI and layout components
- `managers/` ‚Äî Session, storage, and saved places managers
- `public/` ‚Äî Static assets and localization files
- `pages/api/` ‚Äî Backend API routes (e.g., Google Maps, Stripe)

### Core Files and Their Importance

The following files and directories are vital to the Travel-Rizz project's functionality:

- **`pages/api/`**: This directory contains all backend API routes, which are crucial for handling server-side logic, external API integrations (Google Maps, Stripe, Weather, Currency), and session management. Without these, the application would lack its core data processing and external service capabilities.
  - `pages/api/chat/chat.ts`: Main endpoint for AI chat interactions.
  - `pages/api/stripe/webhook.ts`: Handles Stripe payment webhooks, essential for premium feature activation.
- **`managers/`**: This directory houses the logic for session management, local storage, and saved places. These managers are critical for maintaining user state, preferences, and data persistence across sessions.
  - `managers/session-manager.ts`: Core session management logic.
- **`components/`**: Contains the reusable UI components that form the building blocks of the application's user interface. These are essential for a consistent and efficient frontend.
- **`pages/travel-form.tsx`**: This file defines the multi-step travel form, which is a primary entry point for users to initiate their trip planning process. Its functionality is central to the user's initial interaction with the application.
- **`pages/chat/index.tsx`**: This file implements the AI chat interface, which is the core interactive component for AI-powered trip planning and recommendations.
- **`ai/tools.ts`**: This file defines the tools that the AI can use to interact with the application and external APIs.
- **`.env.local`**: This file (not committed to Git) is crucial for securely storing all API keys and sensitive environment variables. The application cannot function correctly without proper configuration of these keys.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Defines the Tailwind CSS configuration, which dictates the application's styling and theming. It's vital for maintaining a consistent and responsive UI.
- **`next.config.js`**: The Next.js configuration file, which controls various aspects of the application's build and runtime behavior, including internationalization, image optimization, and custom webpack configurations.
- **`package.json`**: Lists all project dependencies and scripts. It's fundamental for setting up the development environment and deploying the application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Environment

- **Localization**: Uses `next-intl` for multi-language support.
- **Theming**: Supports light/dark mode with `next-themes`.
- **Google Maps**: API keys are loaded securely from environment variables; frontend and backend keys are separated for security.
- **Stripe**: Integrated for premium features and payment processing.
- **Cookie Consent**: Third-party cookies are used for Stripe; users are notified via a consent banner.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

- API keys are never exposed in the codebase‚Äîuse environment variables.
- Legal pages for privacy, cookies, and terms are provided for compliance.

## üí° Usage

1. Start on the landing page and choose to chat or use the trip planning form.
2. Provide trip details via chat or the multi-step form.
3. Receive AI-generated itineraries, maps, and recommendations.
4. Upgrade for premium features via Stripe if desired.
